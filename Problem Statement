In a world increasingly driven by digital content, individuals and businesses alike rely on
visually appealing images to communicate and engage. However, existing photo editing tools
are often either overly complex for casual users or too limited for those seeking creative
flexibility. Many users face challenges in finding an accessible editing solution that allows for
both essential adjustments and creative enhancements without requiring advanced skills or
expensive software. This project addresses this gap by developing a photo editor that combines
intuitive design with a robust set of features, enabling users of all experience levels to enhance,
personalize, and share high-quality images with ease.

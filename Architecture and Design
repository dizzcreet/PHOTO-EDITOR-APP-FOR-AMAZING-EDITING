Architecture Overview:
The Photo Editor Application adopts a layered architecture:
1. User Interface Layer: Java Swing is utilized to create an intuitive GUI where users
can
access editing tools and manage files.
2. Business Logic Layer: This layer contains the core processing logic, handling
operations such as image transformations and filter applications.
3. Data Layer: JDBC is employed for interaction with an SQL database, storing user
profiles and edited image history.
Design Diagrams:
• UML Class Diagram: Outlines the structure of classes such as User, Editor, and
DatabaseHandler.
• Use Case Diagram: Demonstrates user interactions, including login, image upload,
and
editing functions.
• Database Schema:
o Users table: Stores user credentials and preferences.
o Images table: Keeps records of saved images and associated metadata.
